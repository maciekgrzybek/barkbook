Key Principles
- Leverage Next.js's partial hydration and multi-framework support effectively.
- Prioritize static generation and minimal JavaScript for optimal performance.
- Organize files using Next.js's routing system.

Component Development
- Implement proper component composition and reusability.
- Use component props for data passing.

Routing and Pages
- Use getStaticPaths() for generating static pages with dynamic routes.
- Implement proper 404 handling with a 404.astro page.

Styling
- Prefer Tailwind CSS for styling components
- Leverage global styles when necessary, importing them in layouts.

Tailwind CSS Best Practices
- Use Tailwind utility classes in components.
- Leverage Tailwind's responsive design utilities (sm:, md:, lg:, etc.).
- Utilize Tailwind's color palette and spacing scale for consistency.
- Avoid using the @apply directive

Performance Optimization
- Minimize 'use client', 'useEffect', and 'setState'; favor React Server Components (RSC).
- Wrap client components in Suspense with fallback.
- Use dynamic loading for non-critical components.
- Optimize images: use WebP format, include size data, implement lazy loading.
- Optimize Web Vitals (LCP, CLS, FID).
- Limit 'use client':
  - Favor server components and Next.js SSR.
  - Use only for Web API access in small components.
  - Avoid for data fetching or state management.

Accessibility
- Ensure proper semantic HTML structure in all components.
- Implement ARIA attributes where necessary.
- Implement proper ARIA labels and roles for components.
- Ensure keyboard navigation support for interactive elements.
- Ensure color contrast ratios meet WCAG standards for readability.

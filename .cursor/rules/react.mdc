Key Principles
- Use functional, declarative programming. Avoid classes.
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading, hasError).
- Favor named exports for components.
- Use TypeScript for all code. Prefer interfaces over types.
- File structure: imports, types, main component, subcomponents, helpers, static content.

React Conventions
- Use functional components and TypeScript interfaces.
- Use declarative JSX.
- Use function, not const, for components.
- Use Shadcn UI, Radix, and Tailwind CSS for components and styling.
- Implement responsive design with Tailwind CSS.
- Use mobile-first approach for responsive design.
- Use content variables for static content outside render functions.
- Use Zod for form validation.
- Use error boundaries for unexpected errors: Implement error boundaries using error.tsx and global-error.tsx files.
- Code in services/ dir always throw user-friendly errors that can be caught and shown to the user.
- Handle errors gracefully and return appropriate error messages.
- Implement useId() for generating unique IDs for accessibility attributes
- Use the new use hook for data fetching in React 19+ projects
- Leverage Server Components for {{data_fetching_heavy_components}} when using React with Next.js or similar frameworks
- Consider using the new useOptimistic hook for optimistic UI updates in forms
- Use useTransition for non-urgent state updates to keep the UI responsive

Component Structure
- Extract logic to custom hooks when possible and it makes sense.
- Break down components into smaller parts with minimal props.
- Use composition to build complex components.

Data Fetching and State Management
- In client components - use TanStack Query for data fetching when possible.
- Use jotai for global state management.
- Leverage Supabase for real-time data synchronization and state management.

Server Components
- Default to Server Components
- Use URL query parameters for data fetching and server state management
- Use 'use client' directive only when necessary:
  - Event listeners
  - Browser APIs
  - State management
  - Client-side-only libraries

Styling
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling, following the Utility First approach.
